# MicroFood Owner ERP

MicroFood Owner ERP is a compact, owner-only ERP designed for local food zones, cloud kitchens, bakeries, and food entrepreneurs who need simple but powerful control over inventory, production, and finances. Secure owner login keeps operations private while providing full inventory CRUD with stock movements, optional batch and expiry tracking, and automated purchase receipt that creates batches. Manage recipes and Bills of Materials (BOM), run production batches that auto-deduct ingredients and record waste, and track basic expenses. Itemized sales with optional daily totals feed a clear dashboard showing today’s sales, expenses, inventory value, low-stock and expiring items. Built-in reports provide inventory valuation, detailed sales, and a straightforward P&L (Revenue − COGS − Expenses) to help optimize margins and reduce waste.

Benefits: reduce stockouts, prevent expired-product loss, streamline purchasing and production, and get fast, actionable insights to price and plan. Target audience: small food business owners, market stall operators, commissaries, and micro-producers who want a lightweight ERP focused on food inventory, batch tracking, recipe costing, and simple accounting. Keywords: inventory management, batch expiry tracking, production batching, recipe/BOM, purchases, sales reporting, expenses, P&L, COGS.
